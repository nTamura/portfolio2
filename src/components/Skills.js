      <p className="skills-list">
        <span>HTML, CSS, SASS, JS (ES6), Ruby</span><br />
        <span>React, Node, Express, Rails</span><br />
        <span>MongoDB, Postgres, FireBase</span><br />
        <span>REST, JSON, PWA, Git, Heroku</span><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        What I am currently looking to get into is gain professional experience with React (or similar frameworks), and get into Software Engineering or Mobile Development through PWAs or React Native.
